The Gaming Room

**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**
The client The Gaming Room requested to design and develop a game titled "Draw It or Lose it". The game would have players draw images based on prompts while other players would guess what the drawings were. The client also requested to have the game play online and across different computing platforms. While developing the multi platform game the client also requested the deployment to be scaleable to handle future growth.

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**
By demostrating different cross platform options as well as server back end options. Using real world experience I was able to recommend options that I have used to recommend to clients on other projects. This experience helped consider what options would be best suited for client based deployments, for cloud server hosting deployments, and backup solution deployments. 

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**
Drafting and following the design document helped paint a clear roadmap of how to design the code. By following the clients objectives I was able to add their requirements correctly into the code. By following the roadmap in steps, it helped build up the code slowly by first adding a framework and then the inner structures in pieces. By following best practices in naming conventions this helped add consistency throughout the code. 

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**
